# ROB

ROB is an autonomous clothing manager designed to assist users in better managing their wardrobe and support them in the decision-making process when shopping. It was designed as a response to the growing overconsumption caused by fast fashion.

ROB promotes a circular usage of users’ wardrobe by providing outfit recommendation through an algorithm. ROB uses RFID technology to create an automatic digital wardrobe and track clothes usage, without disrupting users’ routine. This data is also used by the ROB app during shopping: users can scan items to get information about them, their convenience and compatibility referring to their own wardrobe.
